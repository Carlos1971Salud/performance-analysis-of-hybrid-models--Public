Our research project aims to evaluate nine models of Neural Networks, which are LSTM, RNN, GRU and its hybrids using three datasets. 

Read our full paper entitled "Performance Analysis of Neural Network Architectures for Time Series Forecasting: A Comparative Study
of RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Hybrid Models" (hopefully it will  be published soon)
